ParallelTemperingSampler
========================

Derived multi-thermodynamic state multistate class with exchanging configurations between replicas of different
temperatures. This is a special case which accepts a single thermodynamic_state and different temperatures to sample.
If you want different temperatures and Hamiltonians, use ReplicaExchangeSampler with temperatures pre-set.

class ParallelTemperingSampler(ReplicaExchangeSampler):
    """Parallel tempering simulation facility.

    This class provides a facility for parallel tempering simulations. It
    is a subclass of :class:`ReplicaExchange`, but provides efficiency improvements
    for parallel tempering simulations, so should be preferred for this type
    of simulation. In particular, this makes use of the fact that the reduced
    potentials are linear in inverse temperature.

    Examples
    --------

    Create the system.

    >>> from openmm import unit
    >>> from openmmtools import testsystems, states, mcmc
    >>> import tempfile
    >>> testsystem = testsystems.AlanineDipeptideImplicit()
    >>> import os

    Create thermodynamic states for parallel tempering with exponentially-spaced schedule.

    >>> n_replicas = 3  # Number of temperature replicas.
    >>> T_min = 298.0 * unit.kelvin  # Minimum temperature.
    >>> T_max = 600.0 * unit.kelvin  # Maximum temperature.
    >>> reference_state = states.ThermodynamicState(system=testsystem.system, temperature=T_min)

    Initialize simulation object with options. Run with a GHMC integrator.

    >>> move = mcmc.GHMCMove(timestep=2.0*unit.femtoseconds, n_steps=50)
    >>> simulation = ParallelTemperingSampler(mcmc_moves=move, number_of_iterations=2)

    Create simulation with its storage file (in a temporary directory) and run.

    >>> storage_path = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False).name + '.nc'
    >>> reporter = MultiStateReporter(storage_path, checkpoint_interval=10)
    >>> simulation.create(reference_state,
    ...                   states.SamplerState(testsystem.positions),
    ...                   reporter, min_temperature=T_min,
    ...                   max_temperature=T_max, n_temperatures=n_replicas)

        ----------

            Reference thermodynamic state that will be simulated at the given

        sampler_states : openmmtools.states.SamplerState or list
            One or more sets of initial sampler states. If a list of SamplerStates,
            they will be assigned to replicas in a round-robin fashion.
        storage : str or Reporter
            If str: path to the storage file, checkpoint options are default
            If Reporter: Instanced :class:`Reporter` class, checkpoint information is read from
            In the future this will be able to take a Storage class as well.
