Release History
***************

0.17.0 - Development
====================

New features
------------

- ``RadiallySymmetricRestraintForce`` and all subclasses are now a ``CustomCVForce`` subclass wrapping their
  respective ``CustomBondForce`` and ``CustomCentroidBondForce`` objects. This breaks backwards compatibility, but
  enables tracking the restraint distances through the new ``SamplerSate`` collective variable features.

Compatibility Warnings
----------------------
- ``RadiallySymmetricRestraintForce``'s conversion to ``CustomCVForce``'s break the backwards compatibility with older
  codes which implement subclasses of it. The largest change is how the Energy Function is implemented, and subclass
  hierarchy. E.g. All these classes are now ``CustomCVForce``'s instead of ``CustomBondForce`` and
  ``CustomCentroidBondForce`` objects.

     - This affects ``RadiallySymmetricRestraintForce``,
       ``RadiallySymmetricCentroidRestraintForce``, ``RadiallySymmetricBondRestraintForce``,
       ``HarmonicRestraintForceMixIn``, ``HarmonicRestraintForce``, ``HarmonicRestraintBondForce``,
       ``FlatBottomRestraintForceMixIn``, ``FlatBottomRestraintForce``, and ``FlatBottomRestraintBondForce``.


0.16.0 - Py2 deprecated, GlobalParameterState class, SamplerState reads CVs
===========================================================================

New features
------------
- Add ability for ``SamplerState`` to access new `OpenMM Custom CV Force Variables
  <http://docs.openmm.org/development/api-python/generated/simtk.openmm.openmm.CustomCVForce.html#simtk.openmm.openmm.CustomCVForce>`_ 
  (`#362 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/362>`_).
- ``SamplerState.update_from_context`` now has keywords to support finer grain updating from the Context. This is only
  recommended for advanced users (`#362 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/362>`_).
- Added the new class ``states.GlobalParameterState`` designed to simplify the implementation of composable states that
  control global variables (`#363 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/363>`_).
- Allow restraint force classes to be controlled by a parameter other than ``lambda_restraints``. This will enable
  multi-restraints simulations (`#363 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/363>`_).

Enhancements
------------
- Global variables of integrators are now automatically copied over the integrator returned by ``ContextCache.get_context``.
  It is possible to specify exception through ``ContextCache.INCOMPATIBLE_INTEGRATOR_ATTRIBUTES`` (`#364 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/364>`_).

Others
------
- Integrator ``MCMCMove``s now attempt to recover from NaN automatically by default (with ``n_restart_attempts`` set to
  4) (`#364 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/364>`_).

Deprecated
----------
- Python2 is officially deprecated. Support will be dropped in future versions.
- Deprecated the signature of ``IComposableState._on_setattr`` to fix a bug where the objects were temporarily left in
  an inconsistent state when an exception was raised and caught.
- Deprecated ``update_alchemical_charges`` in ``AlchemicalState`` in anticipation of the new implementation of the
  exact PME that will be based on the ``NonbondedForce`` offsets rather than ``updateParametersInContext()``.


0.15.0 - Restraint forces
=========================
- Add radially-symmetric restraint custom forces (`#336 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/336>`_).
- Copy Python attributes of integrators on ``deepcopy()`` (`#336 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/336>`_).
- Optimization of ``states.CompoundThermodynamicState`` deserialization (`#338 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/338>`_).
- Bugfixes (`#332 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/332>`_, `#343 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/343>`_).


0.14.0 - Exact treatment of alchemical PME electrostatics, water cluster test system, optimizations
===================================================================================================

New features
------------
- Add a ``WaterCluster`` testsystem (`#322 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/322>`_)
- Add exact treatment of PME electrostatics in `alchemy.AbsoluteAlchemicalFactory`. (`#320 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/320>`_)
- Add method in ``ThermodynamicState`` for the efficient computation of the reduced potential at a list of states. (`#320 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/320>`_)

Enhancements
------------
- When a ``SamplerState`` is applied to many ``Context``s, the units are stripped only once for optimization. (`#320 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/320>`_)

Bug fixes
---------
- Copy thermodynamic state on compound state initialization. (`#320 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/pull/320>`_)


0.13.4 - Barostat/External Force Bugfix, Restart Robustness
===========================================================

Bug fixes
---------
- Fixed implementation bug where ``CustomExternalForce`` restraining atoms to absolute coordinates caused an issue
  when a Barostat was used (`#310 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/310>`_)

Enhancements
------------
- MCMC Integrators now attempt to re-initialize the ``Context`` object on the last restart attempt when NaN's are
  encountered. This has internally been shown to correct some instances where normally resetting positions does
  not work around the NaN's. This is a slow step relative to just resetting positions, but better than simulation
  crashing.

0.13.3 - Critical Bugfix to SamplerState Context Manipulation
=============================================================

Critical Fixes
--------------

- ``SamplerState.apply_to_context()`` applies box vectors before positions are set to prevent a bug on non-Reference
  OpenMM Platforms which can re-order system atoms. (`#305 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/305>`_)

Additional Fixes
----------------

- LibYAML is now optional (`#304 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/304>`_)

Release 0.9.4 - Nonequilibrium integrators overhaul
===================================================

Major changes
-------------

- Overhaul of ``LangevinIntegrator`` and subclasses to better support nonequilibrium integrators
- Add true reaction-field support to ``AlchemicalFactory``
- Add some alchemical test systems

Updates to ``openmmtools.integrators.LangevinIntegrator`` and friends
---------------------------------------------------------------------

API-breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- The nonequilibrium integrators are now called ``AlchemicalNonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator`` and
  ``ExternalPerturbationLangevinIntegrator``, and both are subclasses of a common ``NonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator``
  that provides a consistent interface to setting and getting ``protocol_work``
- ``AlchemicalNonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator`` now has a default ``alchemical_functions`` to eliminate need for every
  test to treat it as a special case (`#180 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/180>`_)
- The ``get_protocol_work()`` method allows you to retrieve the protocol work from any
  ``NonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator`` subclass and returns a unit-bearing work. The optional ``dimensionless=True``
  argument returns a dimensionless float in units of kT.
- Integrator global variables now store all energies in natural OpenMM units (kJ/mol) but the new accessor methods
  (see below) should b used instead of getting integrator global variables for work and heat.
  (`#181 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/181>`_)
- Any private methods for adding steps to the integrator have been prepended with ``_`` to hide them from the public
  API.

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Order of arguments for all ``LangevinIntegrator`` derivatives matches ``openmm.LangevinIntegrator`` so it can act as a drop-in
  replacement. (`#176 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/176>`_)
- The ``get_shadow_work()`` and ``get_heat()`` methods are now available for any ``LangevinIntegrator`` subclass, as
  well as the corresponding properties ``shadow_work`` and heat. The functions also support ``dimensionless=True.``
  (`#163 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/163>`_)
- The ``shadow_work`` and ``heat`` properties were added to all LangevinIntegrator subclasses, returning the values of
  these properties (if the integrator was constructed with the appropriate ``measure_shadow_work=True`` or
  ``measure_heat=True`` flags) as unit-bearing quantities
- The ``get_protocol_work()`` and ``get_total_work()`` methods are now available for any
  ``NonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator``, returning unit-bearing quantities unless ``dimensionless=True`` is provided in
  which case they return the work in implicit units of kT. ``get_total_work()`` requires the integrator to have been
  constructed with ``measure_shadow_work=True``.
- The ``protocol_work`` and ``total_work`` properties were added to all ``NonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator`` subclasses,
  and return the unit-bearing work quantities. ``total_work`` requires the integrator to have been constructed with
  ``measure_shadow_work=True``.
- The subclasses have been reworked to support any kwargs that the base classes support, and defaults have all been made
  consistent.
- Various reset() methods have been added to reset statistics for all ``LangevinIntegrator`` subclasses.
- All custom integrators support ``.pretty_format()`` and ``.pretty_print()`` with optional highlighting of specific
  step types.

Bugfixes
^^^^^^^^

- Zero-step perturbations now work correctly (`#177 <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/issues/177>`_)
- ``AlchemicalNonequilibriumLangevinIntegrator`` now correctly supports multiple ``H`` steps.

Internal changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Adding new LangevinIntegrator step methods now uses a ``self._register_step_method(step_string, callback_function, supports_force_groups=False)`` call to simplify this process.
- Code duplication has been reduced through the use of calling base class methods whenever possible.
- ``run_nonequilibrium_switching()`` test now uses BAR to test dragging a harmonic oscillator and tests a variety of
  integrator splittings ``(["O { V R H R V } O", "O V R H R V O", "R V O H O V R", "H R V O V R H"])``.
- Integrator tests use deterministic PME and mixed precision when able.

Updates to openmmtools.alchemy.AlchemicalFactory
------------------------------------------------

- Reaction field electrostatics now removes the shift, setting ``c_rf = 0``.

- A convenience method AlchemicalFactory.replace_reaction_field() has been added to allow fully-interacting systems to
  be modified to force ``c_rf = 0`` by recoding reaction-field electrostatics as a ``CustomNonbondedForce``

New ``openmmtools.testsystems`` classes
---------------------------------------

- AlchemicalWaterBox was added, which has the first water molecule in the system alchemically modified
