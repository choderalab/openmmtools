OpenMMTools
===========

A batteries-included toolkit for the GPU-accelerated OpenMM molecular simulation engine.

``openmmtools`` is a Python library layer that sits on top of `OpenMM <http://openmm.org>`_ to provide access to a variety of useful tools for building full-featured molecular simulation packages.

Features include:

 - high-quality Langevin integrators, including `g-BAOAB <http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/472/2189/20160138>`_, `VVVR <http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp411770f>`_, and other splittings
 - integrators that support nonequilibrium switching for free energy calculations or `nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1106094108>`_
 - an extensible Markov chain Monte Carlo framework for mixing Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics-based methods
 - enhanced sampling methods, including replica-exchange (REMD) and self-adjusted mixture sampling (SAMS)
 - factories for generating `alchemically-modified <http://alchemistry.org>`_ systems for absolute and relative free energy calculations
 - a suite of test systems for benchmarking, validation, and debugging
